 <h5>How to move apartment with a cats?</h5>
  <br />
  <p> 
 Moving house with cats can be a daunting task. Not the actual transfer of the cat from one space to another, but its adaptation to the new place. <br />
There will be cats whose adaptation will be rapid and there will be those who have hidden in hiding and in more exceptional cases will not want to drink and eat. <br />
<u>What can we do to make the transition easier? </u> <br />
First, on the day of arrival at the new apartment, place the cat in a quiet room with objects he is familiar with, it is advisable to move as many objects with a familiar smell <br />
to the cat as blankets, pillows, toys, dining facilities,Even the sandbox move as is and not empty before moving, put in the same room. <br />
Keep windows closed, frightened cats may jump out of the window as escape routes. <br />
Apart from the usual food bowl of the cat you can give the cat "treats" in the first days and try to be around and in touch. <br />
After the house was quiet from all the getting organized and the noise they opened the door and allowed the cat to leave whenever he felt comfortable. <br />
